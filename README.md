# Dotfiles and configs
![](./images/ubuntu-overall.png)

# Overview
This repo contains my own dotfiles and custom configurations for some tools that I commonly usein Ubuntu. Actually, I think I use few tools, so my config is pretty straightfoward.

- [Alacritty](#alacritty) for terminal emulation.
- [I3wm](#i3) for window management.
- [Nvim](#nvim) for text editing.
- [Picom](#picom) as window compositor.
- [Polybar](#polybar) as status bar.
- [Rofi](#rofi) for apps launching.

## Alacritty
Contains basic configuration for theming, window padding anddefault font family.

## I3
I think this is the standard and most stable choice for window management.
